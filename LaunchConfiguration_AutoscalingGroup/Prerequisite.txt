    3. Associate the VPC created with IGW

-> Cross check after the above are created:
    1. Check "CustomVPC" created under VPC
        -> inside VPC check the "Main route table is "associate_vpc""
    2. Check "IGW" is created inside internet gateway
        -> inside IGW check "CustomVPC" is associated with it.

Pre-requisite-2: (run the public-subnet scripts 2nd)
    1. 2 Public Subnets (ap-south-1a , ap-south-1b)
    2. Create AWS Route Table for Public Subnets & Associate them

-> Cross check after the above are created:
    1. Go to VPC console -> click Subnets -> "PublicSubnet1" & "PublicSubnet2" are created
    2. open the any one subnet it (PublicSubnet1) -> "PublicRouteTable" is associated
    3. Go to Route tables -> click "PublicRouteTable" -> igw is associated along with local
                             go under "Subnet association" -> Both PublicSubnet1 & PublicSubnet2 associated


############### To Be Created #############
aws security grp for asg
target grp for asg
auto scaling
launch configuration

-> terraform init
-> terraform fmt
-> terraform plan
-> terraform apply -auto-approve

before: 
no ec2 instance

after:
2 ec2 instances created
security gro is created "terraform-asg-security-group"
taget group is created "ASGTG"
autoscaling group is created "webtier_dev234567"
    -> click the "webtier_dev234567" in new tab
in launch configuration -> is created "webtier_dev234567" 
    -> under it click "view user data" ..you will see the scripts

go to the autoscaling group -> it will show desired capasity, min max capacity
    -> under the activity it shows 2 instances created
    -> under instance management it shows 2 instance created in 2 diff availability zones.
